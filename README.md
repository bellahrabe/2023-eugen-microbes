This is code used for the sequencing data processing, statistsical analyses and visualization of data of the manuscript with the title "Microbial latitudinal diversity gradients and lineage-selective exchange between the Atlantic surface ocean and the lower atmosphere" by Hrabe de Angelis et al.

1. dada2.R - Workflow based on https://benjjneb.github.io/dada2/ and customized for the dataset, including filtering parameters
2. Main analyses were performed using https://github.com/EmilRuff/VisuaR, script VisuaR.R and VisuaR_Procrustes.R (Fig. 1A-D, 2A,B,C,D, Fig. 4A,C,F,H, Fig. S2,S3,S9, S10, S12)
3. Core microbiome (Fig. 4D,E,I,J, Fig. S5,)
4. Ternary plots (Fig. 4B,G, S14)
5. Backward Trajectory plots (Fig. 3A)
6. Particle Concentration and Sea Surface Temperature along the cruise track (Fig.2E, 3B)
7. Correlations between different parameters (Fig. S7,S8, S11)
